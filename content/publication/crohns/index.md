abstract = "Early pathological descriptions of Crohn disease (CD) argued for a potential defect in lymph transport;however, this concept has not been thoroughly investigated. In mice, poor healing in response toinfection-induced tissue damage can cause hyperpermeable lymphatic collecting vessels in mesentericadipose tissue that impair antigen and immune cell access to mesenteric lymph nodes (LNs), whichnormally sustain appropriate immunity. To investigate whether analogous changes might occur inhuman intestinal disease, we established a three-dimensional imaging approach to characterize thelymphatic vasculature in mesenteric tissue from controls or patients with CD. In CD specimens, B-cellerich aggregates resembling tertiary lymphoid organs (TLOs) impinged on lymphatic collecting vesselsthat enter and exit LNs. In areas of creeping fat, which characterizes inflammation-affected areas of thebowel in CD, we observed B cells and apparent innate lymphoid cells that had invaded the lymphaticvessel wall, suggesting these cells may be mediators of lymphatic remodeling. Although TLOs have beendescribed in many chronic inflammatory states, their anatomical relationship to preestablished LNs hasnever been revealed. Our data indicate that, at least in the CD-affected mesentery, TLOs are positionedalong collecting lymphatic vessels in a manner expected to affect delivery of lymph to LNs."
